This is an experimental web server written using Java.
You may edit the source code and compile it, but please
give credit to the original author(br45entei@gmail.com).

Recommended startup script for compiled .jar(Windows):
	start "JavaWebServer" /B /WAIT java.exe -jar JavaWebServer.jar
(Of course you can also just double click it)

Version 1.0:
Changelog: Added project to GitHub
	Notes: The "JavaWebServer" and other classes as well are
		very large, as I need to work on organizing code into
		smaller appropriately named classes and other misc. fixes.
